      My name is Joseph Cacioppo, and I am a frontend developer for PIEtech, a financial planning software company in Powhatan, Virginia.
      I began my development career after graduating from the University of Florida in May 2018 with a degree in Computer Science (Go Gators!).
    
      <br> <br>
      I enjoy any opportunity to build creative, innovative, and impactful software. 
      I have worked on many projects over the years, and I could not be more excited to learn and work on more. 
  
      <br> <br>
  
      Below are my technical skills, and then some pictures and explanations of things I've done in my life, so you can get to know me a little better!
