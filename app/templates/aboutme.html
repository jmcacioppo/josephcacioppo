    I am a frontend developer for PIEtech, a financial planning sofware company in Powhatan, Virginia.
    <br>
    I graduated from the University of Florida with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Go Gators!).
    <br>
    I enjoy any opportunity to build creative, innovative, and impactful software. 
    I have worked on many projects over the years, and I could not be more excited to learn and work on more.
